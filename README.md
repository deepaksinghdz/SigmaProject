**Containerization** ~

Explanation of Configuration:

{wordpress service}

Pulls the latest WordPress image.
Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container for access.
Sets environment variables for the database connection.
Defines a volume (wordpress_data) to persist the /wp-content directory, which contains themes, plugins, and uploads.

{db service}

Uses the MySQL 5.7 image.
Configures MySQL environment variables to set up the database, user, and passwords.
Defines a volume (db_data) for persistent storage of the MySQL database files.


**CI/CD Pipeline**

Explanation of Configuration:

pipeline: This defines the start of the pipeline. Each pipeline block contains various stages to be executed.

agent any: This specifies that Jenkins can run the pipeline on any available agent (node). You can specify a particular agent if needed.

**Environment Block**

Environment variables: These are global variables accessible across all pipeline stages.

credentials: This function securely retrieves sensitive data (like database credentials) stored in Jenkins’ credential store. Storing these as environment variables avoids hard-coding sensitive data in the Jenkinsfile.

{Stages} - The pipeline is divided into multiple stages, each with a specific task.

**Build Docker Images**

Purpose: This stage builds Docker images for both WordPress and MySQL containers.
sh: Runs shell commands on the agent.
Docker build command: docker build -t tags the Docker images (here as my_wordpress_app and my_mysql_db) using the specified Dockerfile for each component.

**Run Basic Tests**

Purpose: This stage performs basic tests to ensure the WordPress container works as expected.
Docker run: Launches a temporary container to check if WordPress starts correctly.
curl: Sends an HTTP request to the WordPress container’s homepage to confirm it’s accessible. The -f option in curl fails if the page doesn’t load, causing the pipeline to fail if there’s an issue.
Cleanup: The container is removed after the test with docker rm -f wordpress_test.

**Push Docker Images to AWS ECR**

Purpose: This stage pushes the built Docker images to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), making them available for deployment on AWS.
AWS ECR Login: Uses AWS CLI to authenticate Docker with ECR. get-login-password generates the token, and docker login uses it to log in.
Docker tag: Tags the local images to match the ECR repository naming conventions.
Docker push: Pushes the tagged images to ECR.
(Replace <your-account-id> with your AWS account ID.)

**Deploy to AWS**

Purpose: Deploys the application to AWS, using ECS as an example.
update-service: Forces a new deployment in ECS, replacing the old containers with newly updated ones.
(Replace my-cluster and wordpress-service with your actual ECS cluster and service names.)

**Post Block**

Purpose: Defines actions to be taken at the end of the pipeline.
always: Cleans up Docker images and containers on the Jenkins agent, freeing space after each run.
success and failure: Echo messages indicating whether the deployment succeeded or failed.
